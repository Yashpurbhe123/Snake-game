# Snake-game
Snake game using Python for beginners 
This Python script implements a classic Snake Game using the Turtle graphics library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, growing longer each time it eats food. The game allows the snake to wrap around the screen edges, and it ends if the snake collides with itself. The arrow keys control the snake's direction. The game continuously updates and redraws the snake and food positions to create smooth movement and gameplay.
